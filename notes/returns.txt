Returns- how much you make on your investment

Types of Returns:
- Simple Returns
- Log Returns

Simple Returns:
 R_t = (P_t - P_{t-1}) / P_{t-1}

Log Returns:
    R_t = ln(P_t / P_{t-1})

    where:
        P_t = Price at time t (new price)
        P_{t-1} = Price at time t-1 (old price)

    Log returns are used because they are additive over time. This means that the log return for a period of time is equal to the sum of the log returns for each sub-period within that period. For example, if you have a log return for a day, you can find the log return for a week by adding the log returns for each day of the week.

Time-specific Returns

    - Point-to-Point Return (Single Period Return) 
    - Rolling Return (Return measured continuously over a window)

Volatility: is the standard deviation of returns

Coefficient of Variation: Volatility divided by return

    CV = Volatility / Return

    where:
        Volatility = Standard deviation of returns
        Return = Mean of returns

Low CV = good (less risk per return)
High CV = bad (more risk per return)

i.e. you want to minimize risk while maximizing return

Sharpe Ratio: is the ratio of the mean return to the standard deviation of returns

    Sharpe Ratio = (Mean Return - Risk Free Rate) / Standard Deviation of Returns

    where:
        Mean Return = Average return
        Standard Deviation of Returns = Volatility
        Risk Free Rate = Rate of return on a risk free investment

    High Sharpe Ratio = good (more return per unit of risk)
    Low Sharpe Ratio = bad (less return per unit of risk)

i.e. How efficiently am I being rewarded for the risk I’m taking?

So:

CV asks: “How much risk per return?”
Sharpe asks: “How much return per risk?”

Sharpe is preferred because it accounts for risk-free baseline.

    Note: CV breaks down when mean return is near zero or negative
