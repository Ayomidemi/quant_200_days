Day 1: Returns- how much you make on your investment

Types of Returns:
- Simple Returns
- Log Returns

Simple Returns:
 R_t = (P_t - P_{t-1}) / P_{t-1}

Log Returns:
    R_t = ln(P_t / P_{t-1})

    where:
        P_t = Price at time t (new price)
        P_{t-1} = Price at time t-1 (old price)

    Log returns are used because they are additive over time. This means that the log return for a period of time is equal to the sum of the log returns for each sub-period within that period. For example, if you have a log return for a day, you can find the log return for a week by adding the log returns for each day of the week.

Time-specific Returns

    - Point-to-Point Return (Single Period Return) 
    - Rolling Return (Return measured continuously over a window)

Volatility: is the standard deviation of returns

Coefficient of Variation: Volatility divided by return

    CV = Volatility / Return

    where:
        Volatility = Standard deviation of returns
        Return = Mean of returns

Low CV = good (less risk per return)
High CV = bad (more risk per return)

i.e. you want to minimize risk while maximizing return

Sharpe Ratio: is the ratio of the mean return to the standard deviation of returns

    Sharpe Ratio = (Mean Return - Risk Free Rate) / Standard Deviation of Returns

    where:
        Mean Return = Average return
        Standard Deviation of Returns = Volatility
        Risk Free Rate = Rate of return on a risk free investment

    High Sharpe Ratio = good (more return per unit of risk)
    Low Sharpe Ratio = bad (less return per unit of risk)

i.e. How efficiently am I being rewarded for the risk I’m taking?

So:

CV asks: “How much risk per return?”
Sharpe asks: “How much return per risk?”

Sharpe is preferred because it accounts for risk-free baseline.

    Note: CV breaks down when mean return is near zero or negative




Day 2: Distribution of Returns
    A distribution is simply: The shape of all your returns when you group them.

    Mean return: is the average return over a period of time
    Standard deviation measures the typical movement away from the mean
    Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution i.e. whether returns lean more towards gains or losses.

    Skew = 0	symmetric
    Skew > 0	more big positive jumps (right tail heavier)
    Skew < 0	more big negative crashes (left tail heavier)
    
    Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution i.e. how heavy the tails are or how often extreme events occur.

    Kurtosis = 3	normal distribution
    Kurtosis > 3	heavy tails (more extreme events)
    Kurtosis < 3	light tails (fewer extreme events)
    
    NB: Risk is not just volatility. Risk is what happens in the extremes.

Gaussian Distribution: is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric around the mean.

    Properties:
        - Mean = Median = Mode
        - Skewness = 0
        - Kurtosis = 3
        - 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean
        - 95% of data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean
        - 99.7% of data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean
    
    Gaussian distribution assumes returns are clean, symmetric, and extreme events are rare — but markets often break this assumption.
