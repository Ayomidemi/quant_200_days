# 200 Days of Quantitative Finance

Welcome to my 200-day journey into the world of quantitative finance! This repository documents my daily progress as I work through the **200 Days of Quant** lock in.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each day, I'll be tackling a new concept in quantitative finance, from basic statistics to advanced machine learning techniques. You can follow along with my progress in the following directories:

- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks containing my daily exercises and experiments.
- **`notes/`**: Text files with my notes and reflections on each day's topic.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
quant_200_days/
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for daily exercises
├── notes/              # Daily notes and reflections
├── README.md           # This file
└── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
```

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run the notebooks, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 Usage

To run the notebooks, simply navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the desired notebook:

```bash
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook
```
